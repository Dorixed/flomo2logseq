### How to Migrate Content from Flomo to Logseq

1. Export an offline html file from flomo. It will automatically generate a folder which named by your username in flomo.

2. Run this script in terminal or pycharm to extract the .md files, which are named with the corresponding date.(You need to replace the path of the index.html firstly)

3. Put these generated markdown files into Logseq/journals in your disk.

4. Put the 'file' folder which contains all the image files in your flomo to logseq/assets.

5. That's it.

6. Besides, if you use Mac, you can find this file, logseq, in your iCloud folder, and you can sync the content between different devices.
